# hacker tools

**a list of tools that can be used for it repair and maintenance.**

this is not an exhaustive list, only intended to be a starting point for those looking to build a toolkit.

while these may be useful to a networking and server admins, the tools are chosen for their ability to quickly diagnose and repair common issues on a personal computer (failing harddrives, backups, settings, scanning for malware, etc).

keep these on a usb drive for easy access, and look for portable versions.
